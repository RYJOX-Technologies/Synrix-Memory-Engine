# All files to send Joseph (ready to integrate)

## 1. Joseph pack (docs for his database / flows)

C:\Users\Livew\Desktop\synrix-windows-build\synrix-windows-build\USER_JOURNEY_AND_FLOW.md
C:\Users\Livew\Desktop\synrix-windows-build\synrix-windows-build\RESPONSE_TO_JOSEPH.md
C:\Users\Livew\Desktop\synrix-windows-build\synrix-windows-build\SUMMARY_FOR_JOSEPH.md
C:\Users\Livew\Desktop\synrix-windows-build\synrix-windows-build\FOR_JOSEPH_PACK.md

## 2. License key format / keygen (for his integration)

C:\Users\Livew\Desktop\synrix-windows-build\synrix-windows-build\build\windows\LICENSE_SIGNED_KEY.md
C:\Users\Livew\Desktop\synrix-windows-build\synrix-windows-build\build\windows\tools\synrix_license_keygen.py

(Private key synrix_license_private.key stays with you – do not send. He only needs to know: we run keygen, get one line, store it and send to customer.)

## 3. What customers download (release asset)

C:\Users\Livew\Desktop\synrix-windows-build\synrix-windows-build\packages\synrix-windows.zip

(Same zip for everyone; tier set by key we send them.)

## 4. Repo (if he needs source)

The whole repo is already on GitHub. He can clone it. The docs above are in synrix-windows-build/.
